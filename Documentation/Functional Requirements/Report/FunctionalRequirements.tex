\section{Background, Vision and Scope}
\subsection{Project background}
Without the correct or adeqaute number of resources, learning a new concept may turn out to be a daunting task. This is especially true for students who are studying a Computer Science course yet are not equipped with a practical or theoretical programming background. The motivation behind this project is to develop a tool that is intended to bridge the  gap between inexperience and practical application. The tool will provide the means to simulate program logic through flowcharts in a practical setting. 

\subsection{Project vision}

The aim of this project is to develop a flowchart and planning simulation tool that is simple and intuitive to use. Firstly, this will be accomplished by enhancing the visual nature of the application by making tools in certain contexts more prominent. Additionally, the application should provide informative and clear feedback to the user during the flowchart development phase. It is important that the look-and-feel of the application is uncluttered and uncomplicated so that the user feels at ease to experiment with the tools thereby enhancing the learning experience.

\subsection{Project scope}

The application is compromised of 2 units: flowchart development and flowchart simulation. An explanation of each unit will follow below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Flowchart development

The user is presented with a canvas upon which he can drop flowchart components to create a  complete flowchart.
The application will perform error checking on the constructed flowchart, so that (for example) multiple entry points into a program or certain flowchart components are not allowed. The applicatiom should also warn the user of instances of infinite loops or other  logical error possibilities. 

\item Flowchart simulation

The user should be able to run an error-free flowchart from start to finish. The system should allow for one-click execution of the entire program, as well as step-by-step execution. At all stages during execution, the currently executing component should be
highlighted, as well as the connection path being followed. The program's execution should
be very visually apparent and appealing. The output of the flowchart's execution should also
be apparent. 
\end{itemize}

The following components are specifically excluded from the scope of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item No executable program code generation will be required for this project.
\item No complex design elements (such as user-defined component assemblies) are required.
Only the basic components of standard flowcharts are necessary.\\

\end{itemize}
