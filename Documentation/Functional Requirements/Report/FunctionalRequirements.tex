\section{Vision and scope}
\subsection{Project background}
The flowchart planning and simulation  tool is a visual tool which aims to introduce programming logic to students by providing  a platform to construct  and execute  flowcharts which depict basic programming structures whilst validating whether the flowchart components are valid .

\subsection{Project vision}

Most first year computer science students come from a backgroud void of programming to a programming backgroud 
and they struggle to grasp the logical programming concepts quickly and easily.
Therefore, this project sets out to create an application with a simplified and easy-to-use interface for the planning and simulation of flowcharts, which
can be used in an education setting for an introductory program logic course. The objective is to
develop an application that can feasibly be used in such a practical setting. The application must be
visual in nature, due to the visual nature of flowcharts. The application must facilitate exploration
and experimentation, while providing clear feedback to the user as to how the program executes.

\subsection{Project scope}

The project consists of the following two components:

\begin{itemize}
\item A planning canvas, in which a flowchart can be built using an intuitive drag-and-drop editor.
Flowchart components will be selected and dropped into the canvas, and connected into
complete flowcharts. The system will also have to do error checking on the constructed
flowcharts, so that (for example) multiple entry points into a program or certain flowchart
components are not allowed.
\item An execution system, in which a flowchart can be run from start to finish. The system
should allow for one-click execution of the entire program, as well as step-by-step
execution. At all stages during execution, the currently executing component should be
highlighted, as well as the connection path being followed. The program's execution should
be very visually apparent and appealing. The output of the flowchart's execution should also
be apparent.
\end{itemize}

The following components are specifically excluded from the scope of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item No executable program code generation will be required for this project.
\item No complex design elements (such as user-defined component assemblies) are required.
Only the basic components of standard flowcharts are necessary.\\

\end{itemize}
